Major changes (GUI)
-------------
Drag&Drop support added. You can now drag files from file browser or other application and drop them in mht2htm form. Files will be added to the list. Files can be dropped anywhere on the form. Dropped directories will be ignored. If conversion is in progress new files will not be accepted.
App will not stop/pause if target directory exists but will add number after directory name (e.g. "..._Files (1)", "(2)", "(3)"... )
Unicode support for Windows with other code pages (for SourceDir, OutputDir and MHT file name).
In case that OutputDir can't be created (when user don't have permission to create dir or from some other reason) or selected input file format is wrong (unsupported format, non-mht file selected) then the program will not stop and show error message any more. Instead a error message will be added to the row in History list.
